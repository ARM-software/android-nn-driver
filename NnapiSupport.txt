------ ArmNN for Android NNAPI supported operations ------

This release of ArmNN for Android supports use as a driver for the Android Neural Networks API. It implements the
android.hardware.neuralnetworks@1.0, android.hardware.neuralnetworks@1.1, android.hardware.neuralnetworks@1.2 and
android.hardware.neuralnetworks@1.3
HAL interfaces.

Where operations are not supported by the ArmNN Android NN Driver, the driver indicates this to the framework
appropriately and the framework implements those operations using a CPU implementation.

NOTE: By convention, only those tensor types have been listed above, which are fully supported across all
ArmNN backends.
    - FLOAT16 input tensors are partially supported on most HAL 1.2 operators on the GpuAcc and
    CpuRef backends, however not on CpuAcc.
